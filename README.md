## Problem Statement 

Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!

## About data

This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.
Explore and analyze the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings.

## Analysis done on this dataset by giving answer to this following Questions

- How Many Booking Were Cancelled?
- What is the booking ratio between Resort Hotel and City Hotel?
- What is the percentage of booking for each year?
- Which is the busiest month for hotels?
- From which country most guests come?
- How Long People Stay in the hotel?
- Which was the most booked accommodation type (Single, Couple, Family)?

## Final summary

I had completed a capstone project 1 on Hotel Booking Analysis where the approach is simple as that to know how people are choosing a hotel to stay or booking a hotel based on the location that location may be city area or Resort area. Also, which destination country to choose on which season.
And I get to know after doing this analysis on two hotel-type which are City Hotel and Resort Hotel that People are more likely to stay in City hotel rather than Resort Hotel for a short period of time nearly 1, 2 and 3 days or for a week also and most booking was done in summer season (July-August). Also few nearly 30-40 % people prefer special booking request and most are for City Hotels only. Most people’s choice destination country was Portugal, the UK, France, Spain and Germany. 
Long days stay maybe for 10-14 days they choose resort hotel this is also few people’s priorities. And at last, we found that Most booked accommodation is a couple or we can say, two adults.
